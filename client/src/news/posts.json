These bodies are vital to the human immune system.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut, when their numbers decline to a critical point, pathways for hematopoietic stem cells were switched on. These cells manage the immune system and generate new blood.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“When you starve, the system tries to save energy, and one of the things it can do to save energy is to recycle a lot of the immune cells that are not needed, especially those that may be damaged,” Valter Longo of the USC Davis School of Gerontology, said.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFasting for an extended period of time (up to 48 to 96 hours) changes the human body to consume fat reserves, glucose (sugar), and ketones. Unhealthy white blood cells are also broken down, so that in part, their components can be reused for new, thriving cells.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is considered to be a cell “recycling” of sorts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter a period of fasting, the body’s immune system will generate new blood cells when nutrients begin flowing back into the body.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe main point of interest in this study at USC, they were committed to knowing what drives body systems to rebuild the cells.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo go further into the science a bit…\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe study found that Protein kinase A, an enzyme known to inhibit cell regeneration, was reduced in the systems of people who are fasting. Concentrations of a growth-factor hormone called IGF-1 were also lowered in those who have not eaten in days.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EImportant note: you will want to be careful if you decide to fast on only waterfor extended periods of time. To protect yourself, fasting for two to four days at a time should be done under medical supervision.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother approach to fasting which has produced beneficial results is time restricted eating or “intermittent fasting”. This form of fasting involves eating in an 8 hour window and not eating during the remaining 16 hours.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis could be during a span from noon to 8:00 pm or 9:00 am to 5:00 pm.

They made the discovery after developing a new model to study chronological aging of these cells. They published their findings this month in the journal \u003Cem\u003EStem Cells\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv id=\"text\"\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EChronological aging shows the natural life cycle of the cells &#8212; as opposed to cells that have been unnaturally replicated multiple times or otherwise manipulated in a lab. In order to preserve the cells in their natural state, Penn researchers developed a system to collect and store them without manipulating them, making them available for this study. They found stem cells collected directly from human fat &#8212; called adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) &#8212; can make more proteins than originally thought. This gives them the ability to replicate and maintain their stability, a finding that held true in cells collected from patients of all ages.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&#8220;Our study shows these cells are very robust, even when they are collected from older patients,&#8221; said Ivona Percec, MD, director of Basic Science Research in the Center for Human Appearance and the study&#8217;s lead author. &#8220;It also shows these cells can be potentially used safely in the future, because they require minimal manipulation and maintenance.&#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EStem cells are currently used in a variety of anti-aging treatments and are commonly collected from a variety of tissues. But Percec&#8217;s team specifically found ASCs to be more stable than other cells, a finding that can potentially open the door to new therapies for the prevention and treatment of aging-related diseases.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&#8220;Unlike other adult human stem cells, the rate at which these ASCs multiply stays consistent with age,&#8221; Percec said. &#8220;That means these cells could be far more stable and helpful as we continue to study natural aging.&#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EASCs are not currently approved for direct use by the Food and Drug Administration, so more research is needed. Percec said the next step for her team is to study how chromatin is regulated in ASCs. Essentially, they want to know how tightly the DNA is wound around proteins inside these cells and how this affects aging. The more open the chromatin is, the more the traits affected by the genes inside will be expressed. Percec said she hopes to find out how ASCs can maintain an open profile with aging.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ECredits: University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. &#8220;Stem cells collected from fat may have use in anti-aging treatments: Study shows cells are more stable than previously thought.&#8221; ScienceDaily.

My own experience has been an absolute game changer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHere is a brief explanation of what actually happened and what it means to you.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EWhen cells from your body become drugs\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBanking and growing stem cells is a low risk but gray area. Many clinics in the U.S. will draw your stem cells and send them to a bank, and then the bank will grow the stem cells and ship them back to your doctor so they can use them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is the growing of the stem cells that the FDA is concerned about because under those definitions it means they can classify them as a drug. Conservative physicians ship the stem cells to other countries than do the treatment there. This is what the wealthy elite and pro athletes have been doing for the past eight years – they fly around the world and spend huge amounts of money to get the benefits of stem cells.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is absolutely legal to bank your stem cells, but controversial to inject them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003ECurrent stem cell oversight\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe FDA is balancing the risk of rapid innovation and lower cost and availability in the country, which is why many people still travel abroad for treatments.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAll stem cell procedures are patient-funded right now. A group in LA was performing stem cell therapies for cancer under IRB protocol (a review board that protects the institution from lawsuits and patients from harm). A tumor board approved stem cell treatments and performed them at no cost to patients.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother group – one where I’ve had profoundly effective stem cell work done in Florida – is very cutting edge and by definition controversial. The FDA issued a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm573431.htm\"\u003Ewarning letter \u003C/a\u003Ecalling safety procedures and drug classifications into question. FDA scrutiny doesn’t necessarily mean that the clinic’s treatments were unsafe, but it does mean that regulatory agencies want to see that procedures are established and followed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDifferent attorneys have different opinions about whether a full-on investigation is warranted or should be allowed. Kristin Comella, Chief Science Officer at the clinic, responded to the FDA warning letter \u003Ca href=\"http://us-stemcell.com/uscc-response-to-fda/\"\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003ESome hope for medical freedom\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis gets kind of technical, but an IRB approval is not enough according to the most conservative interpretation of the rules. The FDA requires an investigational new drug application called an IND, at least if you believe that taking your own stem cells out of your body and growing them makes them into a drug.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis a core medical freedom issue. Do you have the inalienable right to choose what you put in your own body? If so, right now, you have to fly to another country to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is hope. Governments are starting to pass legislation to allow people who have a terminal condition to choose any form of therapy they want no matter the regulatory framework.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ETexas has much more lenient laws so you can get procedures like this as long as they are in hospitals. Unfortunately for us, that means they will still be expensive.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThe \u003Ca href=\"https://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/LawsEnforcedbyFDA/SignificantAmendmentstotheFDCAct/21stCenturyCuresAct/default.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ECURES act\u003C/a\u003E has relaxed the law for regenerative medicine so that regulatory agencies may not require large expensive phase 3 clinical trials to bring regenerative medicine to the market.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe truth is that it’s not that hard for a doctor to extract stem cells from your fat and to send them to a bank, and it is quite simple to reinject culture-expanded stem cells intravenously later. It is absurd to require an expensive hospital for a reinjection procedure that you could do in your doctor’s office.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut, quality control is not at all solved for stem cell banking and amplification. A lot can go wrong. That’s why we have standards. That is why the FDA believes that culture expanded stem cells are drugs instead of a part of your body.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EA safety issue or a human rights issue?\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI greatly value academic research and government oversight. It can be very helpful to prevent the rampant fraud that the drug industry is known for. At the same time, I believe that an inalienable human right is the right to choose how we manage our own biology.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA lot of people don’t know this, but only one of the founding fathers was a physician. The rest of them were lawyers and business people, politicians and philosophers. The one physician lobbied strongly to put medical freedom into the Bill of Rights. The others didn’t support it, and it is still not a Constitutional freedom.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI would like the right to choose. I would also like the right to bank and grow my stem cells and use them to live longer, feel better, and perform like a rock star. I promise to read the fine print before I make the decision, but the decision is mine.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a medical issue, but it is also a social justice issue and a human rights issue. Stem cells should rightfully be available to people from every economic class, not just the rich people who can fly to exotic countries where you can get cutting edge treatments.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI hate to be the one to break it to you, but you have a terminal condition.

Dr. Liu explains that; “\u003Cem\u003ETypically, spinal cord injury patients undergo surgery that stabilizes the spine but does very little to restore motor or sensory function. With this study, we are testing procedure that may improve neurological function, which could mean the difference between being permanently paralyzed and being able to use one’s arms and hands.

They have unique properties such as immunomodulatory, proangiogenetic and antifibrotic, therefore, MSCs inhibit inflammation, fibrosis and promote regeneration of tissue damage. These cells can be isolated from bone marrow, adipose tissue, cord blood and potentially from muscle, gingiva and fetal liver. In addition they are non-immunogenic and can be transplanted without conditioning and without immunosuppressive prophylaxis. Therefore, MSCs represent an attractive clinical approach for the treatment of chronic inflammatory, fibrosing and fistulizing diseases[1].\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is considered that the microenvironment of damaged tissues produces factors that attract stem cells to the site of injury and enhances their differentiation into desired cells. Thus, MSCs promote tissue regeneration by differentiating into the injured cells[2]. Moreover, in the presence of MSCs, immature or partially immature antigen presenting cells are produced which turn off T cells leading to down-regulation of activated immune cell reactivity. Due to their immunomodulatory potential, MSCs reduce tissue damage[3].\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are data which were obtained on animal models that MSCs due to their immunosuppression ability can promote tumor growth. It is crucial to specify that it was demonstrated on animals with preexisting malignancies[4]. Moreover, it has been showed that MSCs don&#8217;t undergo malignant transformation in long-term culture[5]. Also, oncogenic transformation of MSCs and induction of malignancy by them wasn&#8217;t seen in vitro or in vivo. Tarte K. et al. in 2010 demonstrated that MSCs with or without chromosomal alterations showed growth arrest and entered senescence without evidence of transformation[6].\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECredits: Swiss Medica\u003C/p\u003E\n",

Hair follicle stem cells (HFSC), the tissue-specific adult stem cells that generate the hair follicles, are also the cells of origin for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a common skin cancer. These HFSCs cycle between periods of activation, during which they can grow, and quiescence, when they remain dormant.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EUsing mouse models, White and Lowry applied known cancer-causing genes (oncogenes) to HFSCs and found that during cell quiescence, the cells could not be made to initiate SCC. Once the HFSC were in their active period, they began growing cancer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&#8220;We found that this tumor suppression via adult stem cell quiescence was mediated by Pten, a gene important in regulating the cell&#8217;s response to signaling pathways,&#8221; White said, &#8220;therefore, stem cell quiescence is a novel form of tumor suppression in hair follicle stem cells, and Pten must be present for the suppression to work.&#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ECredits: sciencedaily.com\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n",

Pluripotent stem cells are so important because they have the potential to develop into every cell in the body, effectively allowing researchers to heal any type of tissue. In the past, these cells were harvested from embryos, but researchers have now figured out how to unlock the potential of pluripotent stem cells using adult cells &#8211; avoiding the controversy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThese cells are known as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) and researchers create them by &#8220;reactivating embryonic genes to &#8216;reprogram&#8217; mature adult cells&#8221;. By doing so, researchers can to an extent, control what these cells become, which means they have the power to regrow damaged tissues.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut it&#8217;s long been known that when an embryo is producing stem cells it also produces something called XEN cells, which are responsible for making \u003Ca href=\"http://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2016/msu-discovers-a-new-kind-of-stem-cell/?utm_campaign=standard-promo&amp;utm_source=msuedu-news-links&amp;utm_medium=msuhome\"\u003Eembryonic tissues\u003C/a\u003E instead of bodily tissues.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EKnowing this, Michigan State University researchers wondered if XEN cells were also being produced during the reprogramming of adult cells into iPS cells.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo test the hypothesis, the team studied iPS cultures and found iXEN colonies flourishing right alongside them. This proves that reprogramming cells in the lab also produces iXEN cells, just like embryos do.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe funny thing about this discovery is that it was literally sitting right in front of countless researchers for years, because these leftover iXEN cells were considered trash, and thrown out after the iPS production process.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&#8220;Other scientists may have seen these cells before, but they were considered to be defective, or cancer-like,&#8221; \u003Ca href=\"http://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2016/msu-discovers-a-new-kind-of-stem-cell/?utm_campaign=standard-promo&amp;utm_source=msuedu-news-links&amp;utm_medium=msuhome\"\u003Esaid Tony Parenti\u003C/a\u003E, the study’s lead author. &#8220;Rather than ignore these cells that have been mislabelled as waste by-products, we found gold in the garbage.&#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo ensure these iXEN cells were not cancer-like, the team studied \u003Ca href=\"http://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2016/msu-discovers-a-new-kind-of-stem-cell/?utm_campaign=standard-promo&amp;utm_source=msuedu-news-links&amp;utm_medium=msuhome\"\u003Emice models\u003C/a\u003E. They also found that they could alter XEN genes inside cells to increase the production of iPS cells and decrease the production of iXEN cells. In other words, the discovery of iXEN cells will allow researchers to improve the production of iPS cells and, therefore, make the whole process a lot easier.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOther than offering a better way to make iPS cells, the researchers believe that studying and using iXEN cells can offer a new way to study birth defects, since the cells are responsible for tissues at early stages of embryonic development.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENow, the team will have to test their findings on humans instead of mice. If everything goes as planned, we could have a brand new type of induced cell on our hands, which is one step closer in their goal of understanding how stem cells can be produced from adult cells.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe team’s findings were reported in \u003Cem\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://www.cell.com/stem-cell-reports/fulltext/S2213-6711(16)00054-0\"\u003EStem Cell Reports\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ECredits: Josh Hrala &#8211; sciencealert.com\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n",

The team is currently testing their approach on large animals, and Dr. Guilak expects to begin human testing within four to five years, if not sooner.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECartilage is a strong, flexible, fibrous tissue that exists in a few different forms throughout your body. Articular cartilage, the focus of this work, coats the ends of bones in your major weight-bearing joints including your knees and hips. It consists of cells called chondrocytes that produce large amounts of a tough, resilient matrix made mostly of collagen fibers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EArticular cartilage continually withstands huge amounts of force—three to five times your body weight during normal activity and ten times your body weight during exercise. It absorbs impact and reduces friction between bones as you sit, walk, run and jump. But over time, that repetitive force can cause it to break down.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“Cartilage is a tissue that has no blood supply, no nerves, no lymphatic system, so it actually has a very poor ability to repair itself,” Dr. Guilak said. Today, he said, more young people are dealing with degenerating cartilage due to sports injuries and obesity, and people in their 40s and 50s with damaged cartilage must decide between limping around for decades or opting for a knee replacement likely to wear out within 20 years, well before the end of their lives.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDr. Guilak and his team have developed a three-dimensional woven scaffold—a dense material made of woven fibers that is strong and flexible—that’s similar to cartilage but is also porous. They print the material on a 3D weaver, which is similar to a 3D printer, but can produce a fiber reinforced structure.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EStem cells are harvested from a patient’s bone marrow or liposuction waste, where they are plentiful and easy to obtain. The cells are exposed to a cocktail of growth factors, hormones and vitamins that converts them into cartilage cells and they can then be injected into the woven scaffold.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe scaffold, now full of cartilage cells, is covered with a tough, gel-like material designed to reduce friction and withstand wear, and the entire synthetic cartilage structure is placed inside the patient.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe synthetic cartilage functions like the real thing, and over the next year or two, the cartilage cells begin to produce their own matrix, which replaces the synthetic parts of the structure. The end result is new, completely natural cartilage that was developed from your own cells.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf the current trials in large animals are successful, the researchers will move on to a long term animal study followed by human trials to test for safety and efficacy, Dr. Guilak said.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOther groups are also involved in cartilage research, including one led by Dr. Eben Alsberg at Case Western Reserve University and Dr. Ali Khademhosseini at Harvard University. Dr. Alsberg called the work at Duke “excellent,” but pointed out that he and his team are taking a slightly different approach. They plan to inject stem cells into water-based gels called hydrogels and then investigate how different factors affect cartilage development. They will adjust factors that influence gel stiffness, cell growth and attachment, and mechanical compression until they find the optimal combination to promote cartilage formation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“The big goal is to take cells…and allow them to do what they’re evolved to do—make tissues,” Dr. Khademhosseini said.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECredits:\u003C/p\u003E\n",

(“Athersys”) (Nasdaq:ATHX) today announced positive results from the analysis of one-year follow-up data from its Phase 2 clinical study of the intravenous administration of MultiStem® cell therapy to treat patients who have suffered an ischemic stroke. Dr. David Hess, lead clinical investigator of this study and a stroke specialist and Chairman of the Department of Neurology at the Medical College of Georgia, Augusta University, presented the summary results today at the 2016 International Stroke Conference in Los Angeles. The one-year data demonstrates that MultiStem-treated subjects on average continued to improve through one year and had a significantly higher rate of “Excellent Outcome” (defined clinically as attaining mRS 0-1, NIHSS 0-1 andBI ≥95) compared to placebo subjects at one year when evaluating all subjects enrolled in the study (p=0.02), i.e., the intent-to-treat population.  The relative improvement in Excellent Outcomes was even more pronounced in the patients who received MultiStem treatment within 36 hours of the stroke (p &lt;0.01).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“We are particularly excited by the one-year follow-up results because they show that MultiStem treatment can significantly increase the number of patients who have an Excellent Outcome, meaning complete or nearly full recovery, over the standard of care when considering all subjects  in the trial,” commented Dr. Gil Van Bokkelen, Chairman &amp; CEO at Athersys.  “The one-year data continues to confirm that MultiStem treatment is well tolerated and is associated with continued improvement of other measures of function through one year.  As we saw in the 90-day interim analysis results announced last April, patients who received MultiStem treatment within 36 hours of the stroke did substantially better than placebo patients and later treatment MultiStem subjects.  As a result, we will continue to focus our ongoing clinical development on treatment within 36 hours of the stroke.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“I am very happy with the results at this one-year time point.  Not only is the treatment effect getting stronger for patients treated within 36 hours, but those treated within 48 hours are showing statistical significance.  This is a true blessing.  This technology has the potential to serve millions of people, many of which could otherwise be paralyzed,” commented Dr. Tadahisa “Hardy” Kagimoto, President of HEALIOS K.K. (“Healios”) (Tokyo Stock Exchange: 4593).  “I am truly impressed with the achievement the Athersys team has made and thrilled to bring this therapy to Japanese patients as soon as possible.  We, at Healios, are committed to bring innovative medical technologies to improve the healthcare of people around the globe.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“The one-year results of the Phase 2 randomized study of MultiStem in ischemic stroke confirm the 90-day results,” commented Dr. Ken Uchino of the Cerebrovascular Center, Cleveland Clinic. “The study provides a strong sign that cell administration, especially in the early timeframe within 36 hours, is associated with more patients having no disability long-term. With the safety demonstrated in the study, I look forward to the Phase 3 study of MultiStem.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EData highlights from the 365-day follow-up data analysis include:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EMultiStem treatment continued to be well tolerated through 365 days;\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAmong all subjects who received MultiStem treatment (n=65), 23.1% of patients achieved an Excellent Outcome at 365 days, compared to 8.2% of patients who received placebo (n=61), and the 14.9% difference was statistically significant (p=0.02) and compared favorably to the 8.8% difference at 90 days;\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAmong patients who received MultiStem treatment within 36 hours following the stroke, 29.0% achieved Excellent Outcomes (n=31), and compared to all placebo subjects (n=61), the 20.8% difference was significant (p&lt;0.01) and also greater than the 9.5% difference at 90 days;\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EProportion of Subjects with Excellent Outcome at Day 90 and Over One Year\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ctable border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"\u003E\n\u003Ctbody\u003E\n\u003Ctr\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003ESubjects\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd colspan=\"3\"\u003EDay 90\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd colspan=\"3\"\u003EDay 365\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003C/tr\u003E\n\u003Ctr\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003EAll MultiStem (n=65)\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E15.4\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E%\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E23.1\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E%\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003C/tr\u003E\n\u003Ctr\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003EAll Placebo (n=61)\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E6.6\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E%\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E8.2\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E%\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003C/tr\u003E\n\u003Ctr\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003EDifference with all placebo\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E8.8\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E%\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd colspan=\"3\"\u003E14.9%*\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003C/tr\u003E\n\u003Ctr\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003EEarly Treatment with MultiStem (n=31)\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E16.1\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E%\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E29.0\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E%\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003C/tr\u003E\n\u003Ctr\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003EDifference with all placebo\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E9.5\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E%\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd colspan=\"3\"\u003E20.8%**\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003C/tr\u003E\n\u003C/tbody\u003E\n\u003C/table\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E*p = 0.02, **p&lt;0.01\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ESubstantial improvements were also observed in the Barthel Index, which is the clinical scale used to assess the ability of patients to live independently.  Among all subjects (65 MultiStem, 61 placebo), 61.5% of MultiStem patients had an excellent outcome in the Barthel Index (≥95), compared to 44.3% of placebo patients (p=0.05); furthermore, 67.7% of the subset of MultiStem patients who had treatment within 36 hours (n=31) achieved an excellent Barthel outcome, representing a 23.4% difference with the incidence for all placebo patients (p=0.03); and\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAmong MultiStem patients who did not achieve an Excellent Outcome at 365 days, there appears to be meaningful benefit from the treatment relative to standard of care, with reductions in average initial hospitalization days, mortality, life threatening adverse events and infections.  For example, comparing all such MultiStem and placebo subjects, MultiStem-treated patients had 1.6 fewer average hospitalization days, and an 11% lower proportion of patients with death or life threatening adverse events.  In addition, when comparing subjects receiving early treatment with MultiStem against all placebo subjects, MultiStem patients had an average of 2.9 fewer hospitalization days, and an 11.4% lower incidence of death or life threatening adverse events.  Further, such MultiStem patients appear to have better functional improvement than these placebo patients over one year, as evidenced by a higher proportion of excellent Barthel Index outcomes (≥95), 50% for MultiStem subjects (and 55% for early treatment MultiStem), compared to 39% for placebo subjects.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“Achievement of an Excellent Outcome is important because it means that a patient has substantially improved in each of the three clinical rating scales used to assess patient improvement and has regained the ability to live and function independently with a high quality of life,” continued Van Bokkelen.  “Furthermore, when evaluating patients that either received no reperfusion therapy, treatment with tPA alone, or mechanical reperfusion alone, we observed a greater than five-fold increase in the proportion of patients that achieved an Excellent Outcome at one year when comparing subjects that received MultiStem treatment within 36 hours versus placebo.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPhase 2 Clinical Study Design\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E\nThe randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial was conducted at sites in the United States and the United Kingdom.  The study was conducted in two parts – a small dose selection phase involving 16 patients in two cohorts, followed by larger efficacy phase of 118 patients.  The evaluable patient population included 8 patients from cohort 2 and the cohort 3 patients, which all received a high dose of treatment or placebo.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe study enrolled subjects who received intravenously either MultiStem treatment or placebo one to two days following the stroke.  Functional and neurological deficit and recovery following the ischemic stroke were evaluated using three standard methods: the modified Rankin Score (mRS), a scale from 0-6 directed to assessing disability; the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS), a scale from 0-42 for evaluating neurological deficit; and the Barthel Index, assessing performance related to activities of daily living on a 100 point scale.  See www.strokecenter.org/professionals/stroke-diagnosis/stroke-assessment-scales/ for additional information on these assessment scales. Additionally, other clinical, safety and biomarker data was collected over the assessment period.   Of the patients evaluated in the study, 65 patients were in the MultiStem treatment group and 61 patients were in the placebo group, and among the MultiStem subjects, 31 received MultiStem treatment within 36 hours following the stroke.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAbout the Disease Condition\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E\nIschemic stroke is caused by a blockage of blood flow to the brain.  A leading cause of death and disability globally, each year more than 15 million people are estimated to suffer a stroke, including more than two million people in the United States, Japan and European Union, combined.  According to the American Heart Association, ischemic strokes comprise more than 85% of all strokes.  Current standard of care for ischemic stroke involves the administration of a thrombolytic (clot dissolving) agent within three to four hours after a stroke has occurred, a narrow window that results in only a small percentage of patients receiving such treatment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAbout MultiStem\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E\nMultiStem cell therapy is a patented regenerative medicine product that has shown the ability to promote tissue repair and healing in a variety of ways, such as through the production of therapeutic factors produced in response to signals of inflammation and tissue damage.  MultiStem therapy’s potential for multidimensional therapeutic impact distinguishes it from traditional biopharmaceutical therapies focused on a single mechanism of benefit. The product represents a unique &#8220;off-the-shelf&#8221; stem cell product that can be manufactured in a scalable manner, may be stored for years in frozen form, and is administered without tissue matching or the need for immune suppression. Based upon its efficacy profile, its novel mechanisms of action, and a favorable and consistent safety profile demonstrated in both preclinical and clinical settings, MultiStem therapy could provide a meaningful benefit to patients, including those suffering from serious diseases and conditions with unmet medical need. Athersys has forged strategic partnerships and a broad network of collaborations to develop MultiStem cell therapy for a variety of indications, with an initial focus in the neurological, cardiovascular and inflammatory and immune disorder areas.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAbout HEALIOS K.K.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E\nHealios is a biotechnology venture leading the field of developing iPS cell-based products for regenerative medicine.

Currently, the most utilized methods to help treat these men include oral medications, injectable medications and penile prostheses.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe sought out new alternatives to treat and potentially even cure erectile dysfunction by using stem cells and biologic-based therapies – treatments that are now being used in various fields of medicine from orthopedics to plastic surgery. We decided to see how their effect will influence Erectile Dysfunction by evaluating blood flow to the penis. In the past we studied Peyronie’s Disease using a similar treatment modality and showed that with a single injection blood flow improved, plaque size decreased, and penile curvature lessened.  There have been many animal studies, as well, showing the benefit of biologic-based therapies in the treatment of Erectile Dysfunction and Peyronie’s Disease.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe chose to use placental matrix derived mesenchymal stem cells in this study on Erectile Dysfunction. We had a small sample of 8 patients who underwent treatment. We had statistically significant increase in blood flow into the penis.  This was demonstrated by an increase in peak systolic velocity using color doppler on ultrasound.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EMedicalResearch.com: What should clinicians and patients take away from your report?\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EDr. \u003C/em\u003E\u003Cem\u003EZahalsky\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cem\u003E: \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EWhile our sample size was small our results were statistically significant.  Blood flow into the penis increased with injection of an amniotic product.  Medicine is rapidly changing and further study is warranted, but as in multiple animal studies and our previous study on Peyronie’s Disease, biologic-based therapies appear to improve erectile dysfunction in humans.  It is unclear if it is the growth factors in the amnion or the stem cells that caused the improvement in blood flow.  Biologic- and Stem Cell-based treatments may prove to be another effective therapeutic approach in men suffering not from erectile dysfunction or Peyronie’s Disease and the entire field of medicine.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EMedicalResearch.com: What recommendations do you have for future research as a result of this study?\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EDr. \u003C/em\u003E\u003Cem\u003EZahalsky\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cem\u003E:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EI can spend all day answering this question.  There have been dozens of published papers in animals using biologics to treat erectile dysfunction and Peyronie’s Disease, and all of these publications have had successful results.  However, I am the first person to publish \u003Cstrong\u003Ehuman\u003C/strong\u003E research on Peyronie’s Disease and the second to publish human research using any biologic-based therapy for Erectile Dysfunction.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe clearly need more human research.  I have started a company called UroCellZ Research and placed twenty experts in the field on my advisory board to help me with this endeavor.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe that biologic-based therapy as applications in Urology specifically using amnion-derived products is in its infancy and I believe more research has to be done throughout the field of Urology.  UroCellZ Research is happy to help with that as well.  During Medical School at Brown University, I received a Master’s Degree with a focus on Epidemiology, so I believe I have uniquely positioned myself to help with this lifelong project.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EMedicalResearch.com: Is there anything else you would like to add?\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EDr. \u003C/em\u003E\u003Cem\u003EZahalsky\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cem\u003E:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EI believe that the use of biologic-based treatments in the field of Urology is in its infancy.  At this point, I have dedicated my career to advancing these technologies.  Although I have now published papers on Erectile Dysfunction and Peyronie’s Disease, in Urology, this is just the tip of the iceberg.  These treatment modalities may help with incontinence procedures, hypospadias repairs, interstitial cystitis, radiation cystitis, dyspareunia and many other Urologic disease processes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMy team believes, amniotic fluid, which is from the genitourinary system and is necessary in fetal development of the genitourinary system, has dozens of growth factors with a yet undiscovered potential in helping in Urologic illnesses.  I have created a company called UroCellZ Research to help with the research and education of Urologists in this field.  I have put together a twenty physician advisory board to help with this endeavor.
